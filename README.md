# Bikesharing Analysis in New York City

An analysis of CitiBike data from August 2019.

## Purpose

The Tableau story can be found [here](https://public.tableau.com/shared/G8W9S7PQJ?:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link).

The purpose of this analysis was to convince investors that a bike-sharing program in Des Moines, IA is a solid business proposal.  While the population between the two cities is different, this analysis can help determine:

- Who uses a bikeshare program?
- What time of day are bikes most likely to be used?
- How much are the bikes used and who uses them the most?

## Results

As you can see above, over three quarters of users in New York City are subscribers to the bikesharing program with nearly two thirds of the users male.

The above map shows the location of where the rides originate from.  The areas that have the larger and darker circles show where most of the rides occur.  These are the areas that you will want to ensure have working bikes available during peak times.
