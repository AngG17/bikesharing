# Bikesharing Analysis in New York City

An analysis of CitiBike data from August 2019.

## Purpose

The Tableau story can be found [here](https://public.tableau.com/shared/G8W9S7PQJ?:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link).

The purpose of this analysis was to convince investors that a bike-sharing program in Des Moines, IA is a solid business proposal.  While the population between the two cities is different, this analysis can help determine:

- Who uses a bikeshare program?
- What time of day are bikes most likely to be used?
- How much are the bikes used and who uses them the most?

## Results

As you can see above, over three quarters of users in New York City are subscribers to the bikesharing program with nearly two thirds of the users male.

The above map shows the location of where the rides originate from.  The areas that have the larger and darker circles show where most of the rides occur.  These are the areas that you will want to ensure have working bikes available during peak times.

Usage of the bikes is greatest in the afternoon, especially around dinner time.  It would be best to have any repairs to bikes completed by 6:00 AM to ensure that the most number of bikes are available to use when traffic is greatest.

The darker color indicates that a specific bike is used more than one that is lighter colored.  It might be a good idea to rotate some of the higher used bikes to areas of lesser usage to keep all bikes in good condition.

This graph show the number of bikes checked out by duration for all users.  Most rides are for less than an hour with the greatest frequency less than 10 minutes in length.

This graph is another representation showing that most riders are male and most rides are less than half an hour.

This heatmap shows the day of week and time of day that has the most number of rides as indicated by the darker color.

![heatmap by gender](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/95720986/160256104-c23b65d9-11c9-499c-8822-d9629019e19d.png)

This heatmap goes one step further and breaks out the usage by gender to help determine which day of the week and what time bikes are used more.

This heatmap shows the number of bike trips for each type of user and gender for each day of the week.

## Summary

In conclusion, bikesharing appears to be a popular option for commuters in New York City to avoid having to drive and find a place to park.  As most usage seems to be around morning and evening commute times, it makes sense that males use the bikes more as females might have a harder time riding bikes in work attire.

In order to make sure the business can stay profitable without the need to replace bikes frequently due to over use, I would explore the following:

- Are the same bikes being used in the same areas and need to be rotated out to areas where there is less frequent use?  Are the same bikes being used on longer trips and may have more wear and tear on the tires, leading to more repairs?
- As people age, do they ride the bikes the same amount or does ridership lessen, leading to the need to advertise to get new, younger users to replace users as they age?
